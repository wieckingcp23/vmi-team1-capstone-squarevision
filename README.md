# Square Vision — 2D Object Recognition Capstone

**Course(s):** CIS 480 (Pre-Capstone) and CIS 490 (Capstone)  
**Institution:** Virginia Military Institute  
**Semester:** 2022–2023  
**Team Members:** Peyton Wiecking, John Barker, Connor Holland, Ian Salyers  
**Instructor:** Dr. Denis Gracanin  
**Advisor:** Dr. Imran Ghani

## Overview
Square Vision is an object recognition software project developed as part of the senior capstone sequence at VMI. The project goal was to design and implement a **computer vision application** capable of identifying and highlighting objects in a 2D video stream.  

This repository contains the **2D implementation** of Square Vision, including sprint code submissions and documentation produced during the development cycle.

---

## Features
- Implemented with **Python** and the **OpenCV** library for image processing.  
- Basic **object detection** using contour analysis and region identification.  
- User interface elements created with **Tkinter** and **CustomTkinter**.  
- Iterative development across **seven sprints**, with progressively refined functionality.  

---

## Repository Structure
- **Sprint Branches:** Each branch (`Sprint1` through `Sprint7`) contains the code and artifacts submitted for that sprint.  
- **Main Branch:** Contains consolidated 2D implementation code and documentation.  

---

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+  
- Libraries:  
  ```bash
  py -m ensurepip --upgrade
  py -m pip install opencv-python
  py -m pip install customtkinter --upgrade
  ```

---

## Learning Outcomes
- Applied computer vision concepts using OpenCV
- Designed and tested a Python GUI for interactive recognition
- Practiced iterative development with sprint-based deliverables
- Gained experience in team collaboration, project planning, and code versioning with GitHub
